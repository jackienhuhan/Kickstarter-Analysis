# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Visualizing theater campaigns outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals through Excel.

## Analysis and Challenges

### According to the chart of 'Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date', the highest number of successful campaigns was in May, and the lowest number of success was in December. You can see the marker on the line graph indicating about 110 outcomes as successful in May before steadily declining until October where there was a small increase before hitting the lowest amount in December at under 40 successful campagins. There was more successful campaigns then failed ones but the two outcomes came very close to each other in December as both makers for each outcome are nearly overlaying each other on the chart. There was a small spike in January for canceled campaigns and a small dip in July, but the canceled campaign numbers remained relatively low.

### Based on the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' chart, the line graph there shows the trend based on precentages of outcomes based on the funding goal. According to the graph, there was a higher precentage of success when the goal had a smaller amount to reach vs having a higher dollar amount, there was a suprising trend where the success rate did hit an all time high in the 35000-40000 dollar amount rangebefore steeply dropping down to 0%. The outcomes for both successful and failed outcomes almost mirror each other in their data according to what is being reflected on the line graph.

### The main challenges to this analysis would be pulling the data set, if done incorrectly it could be disastrous as it would result in a false or misleading chart. It was imperative to be very careful in what data to pull to create both charts. Double checking work at every step is cruical. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May to July had the highest success, while November and December had the lowest amount of success. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Having too high of a goal will negatively impact the percentage of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesn't show how close some goals were to being successful. It also doesn't show how many backers had pledged. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another graph showing amount pledged and number of backers would be a good visual representation to see the correlation based on outcomes.
